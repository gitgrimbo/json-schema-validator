 * {@code id} fragment resolution class

 * but this one plays a particular role). This class helps find a subschema
 * with a given id.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that the draft does not specify anywhere that {@code id} members
 * should have unique values in a same schema! This implementation therefore
 * returns the first schema found with the given id, and you should <b>not</b>
 * rely on the order in which keys are looked up etc (there is no order
 * defined in the keys of a JSON Object!).</p>
