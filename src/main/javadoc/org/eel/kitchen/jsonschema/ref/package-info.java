/**
 * JSON Reference related packages
 *
 * <p>The main package which reprensents a JSON Reference is
 * {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.ref.JsonRef}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Fragments play a particularly important role in JSON References, as such
 * there is a dedicated {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.ref.JsonFragment}
 * class to help resolve a fragment into a JSON document. It has two
 * implementations: {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.ref.JsonPointer} and
 * {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.ref.IdFragment}.</p>
