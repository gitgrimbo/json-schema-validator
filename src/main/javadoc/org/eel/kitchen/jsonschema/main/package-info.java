/**
 * Main schema validation API
 *
 * <p>This package contains all classes you will use to validate your
 * inputs:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>start by creating a {@link
 *     org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchemaFactory},</li>
 *     <li>customize it if need be (by adding new keywords,
 *     removing existing ones, etc),</li>
 *     <li>register a schema,</li>
 *     <li>create a schema instance,</li>
 *     <li>validate your inputs.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A single {@link org.eel.kitchen.jsonschema.main.JsonSchema} instance can
 * validate as many inputs as required. What is more, it is fully thread
 * safe.</p>
